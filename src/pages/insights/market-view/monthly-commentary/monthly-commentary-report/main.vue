                                The Fed surprised markets by embracing higher inflation and heralding a lift-off from zero rates in 2023,
                                rather than 2024. We think this could add to its new framework's credibility as long as last week's fall in
                                inflation expectations does not persist. Ultimately, the Fed's outlook implies a more muted response to
                                rising inflation than in the past. This and the economic restart keep us pro-risk.

                                    We see the U.S. and UK leading the developed world’s economic restart – with the euro area catching up - powered by pent-up demand and sky-high excess savings.
                                    The huge growth spurt will be transitory, in our view. This is because a restart is not a recovery: the more activity restarts now, the less there will be to restart later.

                                    Fed officials in June projected higher inflation and moved up the lift-off in policy rates to 2023. We believe this confirmed our new nominal theme – that interest rates
                                    will rise more slowly than in the past in response to higher inflation – as the Fed’s acknowledgement of rising price pressures has not translated into projections for
                                    significantly higher interest rates any time soon.

                                    We expect short-term rates will stay anchored near zero, supporting equity valuations. The Fed could be more willing to lean against rising long-term yields than the past, yet the
                                    direction of travel over the next few years is clearly towards higher long-term yields. We see important limits on the level of yields the global economy can withstand.

                                    credit, especially investment grade, has come under pressure
                                    from tightening spreads, but we still like high yield for income.

                                    We are strategically underweight nominal government bonds
                                    as their ability to act as portfolio ballasts are diminished with
                                    yields near lower bounds and rising debt levels may eventually
                                    pose risks to the low-rate regime. This is part of why we
                                    underweight government debt strategically. We prefer inflation
                                    -linked bonds as we see risks of higher inflation in the medium
                                    term. We are underweight duration on a tactical basis as we
                                    anticipate gradual increases in nominal yields supported by the
                                    economic restart.
